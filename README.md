This repository is dedicated to collect all the efforts and videos of jordan competitive programming community and make 
a clear Roadmap for new trainee and will be exported to website.

##### Main Goals:
- Videos should be in arabic (Language barrier).
- Centralize the effort from all jordan universities.
- Provide clear road map for beginners.
- The point is to not write new content as mush as provide where is the resources.

##### How to contribute:
This repository is an open-source you can always push a modification.

There is template written on how the blog should look like , you can find it in `template.md`.
